## Hey! :wave:
## I'm <a href="https://github.com/Folagbade1/">Vedant</a> currently a Research Assistant  and an aspiring biomedical researcher  with interest in using bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics to predict protein-protein interactions during infections by multidrug resistant bacteria. I am currently learning about bioinformatics. I am currently partaking in the Hackbio internship and I am beginning to fall in love with programming :neutral_face:
